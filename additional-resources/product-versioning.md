# Product Versioning

Specter is continuously evolving, with new features being introduced and existing ones being enhanced to better serve the needs of our community. To manage this process effectively and keep all users informed, Specter employs a structured versioning approach.

### **Understanding Specter Versions**

**Major Updates:** Significant changes that may introduce new features, remove deprecated functionalities, or include changes that are not backward compatible. These are indicated by a change in the first number of our versioning sequence (e.g., 2.0.0).

**Minor Updates:** These updates include backward-compatible enhancements and additions to the existing features. Minor updates are reflected in the second number of our version sequence (e.g., 1.1.0).

**Patches:** Small, backward-compatible bug fixes or security patches that improve the functionality and security of Specter without adding new features. Patches are indicated by the third number in our version sequence (e.g., 1.0.1).
