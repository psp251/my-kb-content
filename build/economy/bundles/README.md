# üéÅ Bundles

Bundles in Specter represent collections of in-game assets, bringing together various items and currencies in a coherent package. By offering an assortment of elements in a single entity, bundles cater to diverse gaming scenarios, enhance strategic depth, and invigorate player interest.

From grouping a set of character skins to forming a starter pack with virtual currency and essential items, bundles cover a wide spectrum of gaming needs. These collections can be tailored to serve as rewards, populate player inventories, or get showcased in virtual stores, thereby boosting player engagement and enriching your game's economy.

Recognising the varying bundle requirements of different games, Specter allows a high degree of customisation. You can set the quantity of each item or currency within a bundle, matching them to your game design and strategic goals. Similar to items, bundles can have various types and subtypes, further adding to their flexibility.

An exciting feature of Specter's bundle management is the ability to mimic container behaviour. By configuring the way bundles unpack their content, you can create surprise elements or level-based unlocks, adding another layer of intrigue to your gameplay.

Accessibility of bundles can be finely controlled through segmentation, ensuring a customised and engaging experience for each player demographic. Bundles can also be locked based on various parameters, managing their availability and interaction within your game world.

Leveraging our robust API suite, you can seamlessly manage player inventories, grant bundles, and regulate their state. Whether it's rewarding players, facilitating purchases, or controlling bundle unpacking, you have the tools to stimulate a dynamic in-game economy.
