# üîê Managing Bundle Access

Just as items in Specter can have controlled access, bundles also possess a similar feature. The concept of access allows you to structure your game's progression and rewards system meticulously. It lets you decide if players need a certain item, bundle, or specific progression level to access a bundle. This can aid in staging gameplay, incentivising player progress, and introducing complex gameplay elements.

**Example**: Consider a strategy MMO. Access to a `Fortress Construction Kit` bundle may be locked unless a player possesses the `Master Architect's Blueprint` (an item or perhaps another bundle). The blueprint, therefore, unlocks the `Fortress Construction Kit` bundle, creating an interesting gameplay dynamic.

To set this, simply select '**Lock By**' and choose '**Item/Bundle**' from the dropdown menu. Then, specify the required item or bundle that grants access to the new bundle.

Drawing a parallel from items, bundles can also be locked based on a player's progression within the game.

**Example**: In a sci-fi RPG, a `Starship Upgrade Pack` (bundle) might only become available when a player achieves Rank 10 in the `Starfleet Academy` progression system.

To set this, select '**Lock By**' and choose '**Progression System**' from the dropdown menu. Then, specify the progression system and the necessary level to unlock the bundle.

Just as you use these mechanisms to create a structured flow in your game with items, you can apply the same principles to bundles, adding an extra layer of intrigue, incentivising player progression, and enhancing gameplay dynamism.\
