# ðŸ’Ž Currencies

Currencies are the lifeblood of a game's economy, driving all transactions and exchanges within it. Specter's architecture offers comprehensive support for diverse currency systems, mirroring the myriad ways in which games today incorporate currencies. Ranging from traditional virtual currencies like 'soft' and 'hard' currencies, to direct in-app purchases (IAPs) facilitated by real-world money, our system is equipped to manage it all.

We also offer support for Real Money Gaming (RMG), a growing niche in the gaming industry, where the in-game currency mirrors real-world currency values. Specter simplifies the management of this system by providing multiple wallets, each designed to handle specific types of transactions such as deposits, winnings, and bonuses. All wallets operate under specific rules and constraints. Further details about this will be covered under our dedicated [Real Money Gaming ](https://www.dirtcube.xyz/)section.

Within the Specter environment, each currency you build results in the creation of corresponding wallets in our backend, enabling smooth transactions and balance management. Our APIs empower you to regulate player wallet balances, monitor transaction histories, and conduct purchases using the defined currencies. Currencies, being expendable, function as an important medium for players to unlock in-game content, bonuses, and unique experiences.

Additionally, currencies can be retailed directly in the store or via bundles. The latter offers an exciting prospect to pair currencies with other items, creating unique reward bundles that enhance gameplay. More on this will be explained in the upcoming [Bundles](../bundles/) section.
