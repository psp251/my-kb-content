### Pricing

1. **Pricing Options**: This involves selecting a currency (Virtual, IAP, or Real Money Gaming Currency), setting the price amount, and if desired, specifying a discount.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you choose to use Real Money Gaming (RMG) Currency, there's an added field for '**Bonus Cash Allowance**.' This field allows you to set the maximum amount of bonus cash (part of your RMG Currency) that can be used when purchasing the item. If a player possesses the applicable bonus cash, it will be automatically deducted during the purchase, up to the set maximum amount.
{% endhint %}

To learn about how bonus cash functions and how RMG Currency operates in more detail, refer to the dedicated [Real Money Gaming](https://www.dirtcube.xyz) section.

An item can also be priced by combining different currency options.
