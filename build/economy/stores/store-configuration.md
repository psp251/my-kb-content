# ⚙️ Store Configuration

To set up a store, you first need to navigate to the 'Economy' section under the 'Build' category. Click on 'Stores' and then select the '**Create Store**' button to access the store configuration settings.

### Store Information

This is where you enter the basic information about your store.

1. **Store Icon:** Assign an attractive graphic representation for your store.
2. **Display Name:** Set the name for your store as it will appear to players.
3. **Store ID:** Enter a unique identifier for your store.
4. **Store Description:** Describe your store to give players a better understanding of what they can expect to find in it.
5. **Add No of Categories:** Enter the number of categories you want in your store. The number you input will generate that many categories for you to fill.

### Category Information

This is where you provide information for each category you have created in your store.

1. **Category Icon:** Assign a graphic representation for each category.
2. **Category Name:** Set the name for each category.
3. **Category ID:** Enter a unique identifier for each category.
4. **Add Content to Category:** Select the items or bundles that belong to each category. Currencies need to be added to bundles in order to be added to stores.
5. **Set Store Price:** While configuring the pricing for store content, you'll find the process mirrors that of items and bundles. It involves selecting a currency type (Virtual, IAP, or Real Money Gaming Currency), setting the price amount, and if desired, offering a discount.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you choose Real Money Gaming (RMG) Currency as your pricing medium, an additional field for '**Bonus Cash Allowance**' appears. This field sets the maximum amount of bonus cash (part of your RMG Currency) that can be used for purchasing the store content. If players possess the required bonus cash, it will be automatically deducted during the purchase, up to the maximum amount.
{% endhint %}

For an in-depth understanding of how bonus cash operates and the functionality of RMG Currency, you're advised to refer to the dedicated [Real Money Gaming](https://www.dirtcube.xyz) section.

{% hint style="info" %}
For each piece of content, assign a price that can be virtual, IAP, or RMG currency. The store price will override the root price of an item or bundle.
{% endhint %}

Learn more about this in the dedicated [Store Content Pricing ](store-content-pricing.md)section.

{% hint style="info" %}
A combination of currencies can also be used to price store content.
