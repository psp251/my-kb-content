# ⚙️ Events Configuration

Venture into the 'Build' segment and click on 'Events'. This is where you'll initiate your game's event configuration process. Specter already comes with some events pre-configured. To modify these or to append parameters, simply press the '**Edit**' icon. For those events not predefined by Specter, you have the freedom to add all details as you envision. Press the '**Create Event**' button to dive into the configuration details.

### Event Information

1. **Event Name**: Clearly name your event for easy identification.
2. **Event ID**: Input a unique identifier for this event.
3. **Event Description**: Offer a brief description or context regarding this event.

### Event Parameters

To inject parameters, click the **'+'** icon. For each one:

1. **Parameter Name**: Label each parameter meaningfully.
2. **Parameter Type**: Use the radio button to discern if the parameter is a '**Statistic**' (an ongoing tally of activities) or a '**State**' (a status within the game).
3. **Data Type**: Specify the nature of the data you'll capture (e.g., string, integer, etc.)

{% hint style="info" %}
For the events under the umbrella of Specter's APIs, modifications to the base structure are restricted. However, you possess the latitude to append other backend or custom parameters, amplifying the depth of data captured during gameplay. Should you wish to get a comprehensive view, the default and optional parameters are also presented for clarity.
