# ðŸŽ® Games

The Games section serves as your hub for managing all the games within your application. This area provides you with the ability to create new games, oversee and modify existing ones, and archive games when necessary. Its design emphasises flexibility and scalability, making it capable of accommodating applications that host multiple games.

For instance, an application might function as a comprehensive gaming platform, hosting a variety of games, each with its own unique appeal. From simple puzzle games to complex strategy games, all can be managed within this section.

Another example could be a single game application that has different modes, each treated as a separate game. This division allows you to handle the modes separately, providing each mode with its own distinctive setting, whilst still under the umbrella of the same application. Thus, the Games section provides you with the flexibility to structure your application in a way that best fits your creative vision and operational needs.
