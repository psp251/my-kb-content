# ðŸ’¡ Understanding Apps and Games on Specter

Within Specter's system, an 'App' functions similarly to a 'Game'. An 'App' can be thought of as the base unit that can house multiple games, akin to a gaming platform. This modular approach provides the flexibility to host and manage multiple games within a single project, each with its unique configurations. However, functionalities such as economy and engagement features are maintained at the 'App' level to ensure operational efficiency.

Apps and games can be archived but not deleted from the system. The archiving feature provides a way to keep your workspace organised without permanently losing any data or configurations.
