# üïπÔ∏è Matches

Matches in Specter form the bedrock of your competitive gaming environment, designed to cater to diverse gameplay experiences. These are customisable to accommodate various formats, be it single-player, multiplayer, or team-based competitions. Depending on your game's needs, matches can be structured under your main application or within individual games, offering a high level of flexibility.

They also provide the basis for implementing matchmaking rules, which ensure balanced and competitive gameplay. Therefore, Specter's Matches module is a comprehensive toolset that aids in tailoring an engaging, challenging, and fair gaming environment.&#x20;

Beyond gameplay, matches are crucial for generating key metrics and establishing leaderboards, making them an essential part of the player engagement strategy.&#x20;

While you can create Leaderboards within the Matches section, remember that they also exist as a standalone module with its own detailed documentation. For a comprehensive understanding of creating, managing, and using Leaderboards, please refer to the [Leaderboards](https://www.dirtcube.xyz/) documentation.
