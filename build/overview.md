# ⚒️ Overview

The Build module is the cornerstone of your game development process. It provides a suite of tools and features, all designed to enable you to effectively construct, control, and enhance your gaming application.

The Build module is categorised into the following subsections:

***

### [Games](games/)

This is where you create, manage, and archive individual games within your application.

***

### [Matches](matches/)

This section is designed for defining and managing the match-making mechanics of your games. It provides the necessary tools to create different match formats, set rules, and manage match-related aspects to ensure smooth multiplayer experiences.

***

### [Economy](economy/)

Here you can establish the economic parameters of your game. This includes defining the in-game currencies, creating purchasable items, setting up bundles of items, and establishing the stores where these items or bundles can be purchased.

***

### [Progression](progression/)

This section allows you to set the progression markers and systems for your game. Here, you can define the various levels, set rewards, and generally control how players progress through your game.

***

### [Events](events/)

In this section, you can schedule and manage in-game events. Events in Specter are the underpinning elements that drive in-game activities and Specter's in-built functions. They are the crucial link, acting as customisable triggers that respond in real-time to player actions or specific game circumstances.&#x20;

Each of these sections is further divided into subsections, providing you with the granularity you need to fully control and customise your game's backend operations. The Build module provides a comprehensive toolkit to realise your game's design and mechanics according to your vision.
