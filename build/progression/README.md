# ðŸš€ Progression

Progression is crucial to enriching player engagement in games and apps. Within Specter's progression framework, there are two essential components:

1. [**Progression Markers**](progression-markers/): These serve as quantitative indicators of a player's advancement.&#x20;
2. [**Progression Systems**](progression-systems/): This provides the structure that determines how these markers translate into levels or stages.

{% hint style="info" %}
In a fantasy game,Experience Points (XP) act as **Progression Markers**, gained from battles or quests. Using **Progression Systems**, 100 XP might signify reaching Level 2, while an additional 250 XP advances a player to Level 3.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

This system structures the player's in-game journey through these set milestones.&#x20;

Further integrating with other features in Specter, these tools allow developers to create varied player experiences, from ranking systems to reward-based structures.&#x20;

To leverage Specter's progression capabilities to the fullest, explore the detailed sections on Progression Markers and Progression Systems.
