# üìç Progression Markers

Progression Markers within Specter are integral components in constructing rich, engaging player journeys. They function much like experience points (XP) in traditional gaming systems, serving as quantitative measures of a player's progression in the game.

In essence, these markers are akin to a form of non-expendable currency. While they share the quantitative nature of currencies, their use in Specter diverges significantly; they cannot be spent on purchases or transactions within the game. Instead, these markers act as milestones, punctuating the player's path and measuring their achievements.

Progression Markers provide the building blocks from which you can construct complex progression systems, such as level systems or skill trees. Their numerical nature allows you to set thresholds and goals for players to strive towards, creating compelling gameplay narratives and fostering a sense of achievement and motivation.

Players can earn these markers through successful task completion or reaching milestones within the game, making them instrumental in encouraging continued engagement and gameplay.

The detailed utilisation of Progression Markers within progression systems will be covered in more depth in our dedicated [Progression Systems](../progression-systems/) documentation. Rest assured, with Specter, the creation, management, and implementation of these Progression Markers is streamlined and flexible, empowering you to create unique and compelling player journeys.
