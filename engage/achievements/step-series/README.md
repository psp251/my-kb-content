# ðŸªœ Step Series

Step Series in Specter are ladder-based challenges where players must complete tasks in a specific order to progress. Each step in the series requires the completion of one task before moving on to the next, guiding players through a structured sequence of challenges. This setup is ideal for directing player progression, offering a clear path through tutorials, skill development, or narrative experiences. Configuring a Step Series involves adding steps that consist of either existing tasks or creating new ones, with the sequence of these steps defining the player's journey. Rewards can be set for completing the entire series, motivating players to engage with content progressively. Step Series effectively combine sequential task completion with meaningful progression and rewards, enhancing the player's engagement and sense of achievement within the game.
