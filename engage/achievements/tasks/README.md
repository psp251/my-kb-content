# ✅ Tasks

Tasks in Specter emerge as the fulcrum of engagement, acting as pivotal touch points in a player’s gaming experience. They are tangible goals set for the player, rooted in their interactions within the game environment. These goals, when accomplished, offer rewards, serving as both a motivation and a recognition of a player's achievements.

Each task is triggered by a specific event, but its completion hinges on task parameters, which intricately combine event specifics with Specter's inherent system knowledge.

Consider the variety of tasks available:

1. **Static Tasks**: These are consistent objectives within the game. For instance, a static task might challenge a player to "Collect 50 Gold Coins." This task can be set as a one-time achievement or as a repetitive goal that players can accomplish multiple times.
2. **Timed Tasks**: These tasks are time-sensitive and have a set frequency. A daily task, for example, might ask players to "Complete 3 Matches" every day, while a weekly task might encourage players to "Win 10 Duels" over a week.

Moreover, tasks are versatile. While they can function independently, they also act as foundational elements for more intricate structures such as Missions, Step Series, and Battle Passes. This flexibility in task creation and assignment ensures players remain engaged, with fresh challenges and objectives regularly presented to them.

As you further navigate Specter's capabilities, the versatility and power of Tasks will become evident, underscoring their importance in crafting memorable gaming narratives.
