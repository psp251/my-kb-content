# ⚔️ Competitions

In Specter, the Competitions section is the gateway to creating and managing diverse competitive events, ranging from Tournaments and Instant Battles to Bracket Tournaments. Each competition type is designed to cater to different competitive structures and player engagement strategies.

* **Tournaments**: These are leaderboard-based competitions within a specified timeframe. Players compete to rank on the leaderboard, with outcomes determined by their performance across multiple matches.
* **Instant Battles**: Focus on the outcome of a single match, offering quick and intense competitive experiences.
* **Bracket Tournaments**: Players progress through rounds, facing off in a knockout format until a champion emerges.

Competitions are configured in the Competitions section and then scheduled via the Live Ops section under Competition Scheduling. This separation allows for detailed competition setup, including rules and rewards, before defining the operational timeframe.
