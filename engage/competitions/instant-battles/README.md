# ðŸ¥Š Instant Battles

Instant Battles in Specter are straightforward, single-match competitions where the outcome of that one game determines the winner. This setup offers a quick and intense competitive experience, perfect for players looking for fast action and immediate results.

For example, in a game like "Call of Duty," two players might enter an Instant Battle to compete in a one-on-one deathmatch. The player with the most kills at the end of the match wins the battle. This simplicity makes Instant Battles appealing for both casual and competitive players, allowing for rapid contests that are easy to join but challenging to master.
