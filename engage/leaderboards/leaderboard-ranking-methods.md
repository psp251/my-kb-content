### **High Score**

**Description:** The high score method ranks players based on the highest scores they achieve in a game. This method is straightforward and is commonly used in many gaming contexts, especially in arcade and action games.

**Example:** In a classic arcade shooter game, players are ranked on the leaderboard based on the total points they accumulate by defeating enemies. The player with the highest total points at the end of the game period tops the leaderboard.

### **Time Trial**

**Description:** Time trial ranks players based on the quickest completion times for a given challenge or game level. This method is ideal for racing games or any game where speed and efficiency are key.

**Example:** In a racing game, players compete to complete tracks in the shortest amount of time possible. The leaderboard ranks players from fastest to slowest based on their best lap times, with the fastest time securing the top position.

### **Position Weighting**

**Description:** Position weighting involves ranking players based on an aggregate score derived from their positions in various matches or competitions. This method is well-suited for games with multiple rounds or stages.

**Example:** In a battle royale game, players are ranked across several matches based on their finishing positions (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd). Points are assigned inversely to their ranks (more points for higher positions) across matches, and the leaderboard reflects the cumulative score, highlighting players who consistently perform well.

### **Cumulative Score**

**Description:** This method ranks players based on their total or accumulated score in a game.&#x20;

**Example:** In a strategy game with an in-game economy, players can earn gold by completing missions, trading resources, or conquering territories. The leaderboard ranks players based on their total gold earned, showcasing the wealthiest or most economically savvy players.

### **Win/Loss/Draw Points**

**Description:** Players are ranked based on points attributed to wins, losses, and draws. This method is versatile, applicable to almost any competitive game format, especially where matches have clear outcomes.

**Example:** In a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, teams compete in matches that result in a win, loss, or draw. Teams receive points based on the match outcomes (e.g., 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a loss). The leaderboard ranks teams based on their accumulated points, promoting consistent performance across games.
