# ℹ️ Player Data

The Player Data section within Specter is a dynamic and essential tool for managing detailed information about players' interactions and behaviors within your game. This feature is designed to store and retrieve customizable key-value pairs that represent various aspects of a player's game experience. The data stored can range from game progress metrics to personalized player preferences, offering a versatile framework for enhancing player engagement and game personalization.

### Key Features of Player Data

* **Customizable Key-Value Pairs**: Developers can define specific data points (keys) and assign values in JSON format, allowing for structured, hierarchical data storage that can encompass complex game states, configurations, or player attributes.
* **JSON Editor**: For each key-value pair, clicking on the value field opens a JSON editor. This specialized editor facilitates the structured input and modification of JSON data, ensuring accuracy and ease of data manipulation.
* **Public and Private Permissions**: Each key-value pair can be set with either public or private permissions. Public data can be accessed by the player or other game services, fostering community engagement or competitive elements. Private data is restricted to game developers and administrators, suitable for sensitive or game-internal information.

### Managing Player Data

To manage player data, navigate to the Players section and look for the 'Player Data' subsection. Here, developers have the flexibility to add, edit, or delete key-value pairs based on the current needs of the game or for testing purposes.

**Creating and Editing Data**

1. **Adding New Data**: Click on the 'Add Data' button to introduce a new key-value pair. Enter the key name and value in the JSON editor. Choose the appropriate permission setting (public or private) for this data point.
2. **Editing Existing Data**: To modify an existing key-value pair, click on the value next to the key you wish to change. The JSON editor will appear, allowing you to edit the value. After making changes, save your edits to ensure they are applied.
3. **Setting Permissions**: While adding or editing data, select the permission level for each key-value pair to control visibility and access.

### Saving Changes

After creating or editing key-value pairs, clicking the 'Save' button is crucial to ensure all modifications are correctly stored and reflected within the player's profile. This action updates the player data in real time, allowing for immediate application within the game's environment.

The Player Data section is a powerful aspect of Specter's player management capabilities, providing developers with the means to store, manage, and utilize detailed player-specific information. This flexibility not only aids in creating a more engaging and personalized gaming experience but also supports developers in testing and refining their games to meet the diverse needs of their player base.
