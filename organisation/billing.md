The Billing section in the Specter organization dashboard is the hub for managing financial transactions and monitoring the status of plan subscriptions associated with your account. Given that Specter is in its beta phase, we are currently offering our full suite of features free of charge. This initiative is aimed at refining our platform and ensuring it aligns with the diverse needs of our user base.
